Lazy query
}
\description{
Given the year and the SeasonGameId, find all games between the same two
teams either earlier in the same day (when \code{before} is \code{TRUE}) or later
in the same day (when \code{before} is \code{FALSE}).  The result is a lazy query
to the game_logs table.
}
\details{
The result is normally empty, and is only interesting when there is a
double-header.
